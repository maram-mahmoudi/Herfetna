    <h4>about us</h4>
    <p> Welcome to Hertfna, a platform dedicated to promoting and preserving the beauty of handmade art. Our mission is to provide a space for artists and artisans to showcase and sell their unique creations, while also fostering appreciation for the skill and talent required to produce them.
        We believe that the preservation of handicrafts is not only important for the artists themselves, but also for the cultural heritage of the countries they come from. By supporting these artists, we hope to not only help them succeed in their creative endeavors, but also to showcase the rich and diverse traditions of different cultures around the world.
        Join us in our mission to celebrate and promote the value of handmade art. Together, we can help preserve the legacy of these crafts and ensure that they continue to inspire and delight for generations to come.</p>
